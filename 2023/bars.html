            <strong>Arlington Rooftop Bar and Grill</strong>To quote the great
            philosopher Reggie Jackson, is "the straw that stirs the drink."
            This festive occasion you have all come to know and love would not
            be possible had Josh and Jake moved in across the street from a
            coffee shop instead of a bar in late summer 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rooftop, in many ways, sparked the idea for JUNEFEST. Why have bar
            crawls indoors in DC when the weather is cold in December or March
            when you can make up your own holiday, walk across the street, get
            drunk outside, and wear Hawaiian shirts and bucket hats?
          </p>
          <p>
            Cheers to Rooftop, the first bar in JUNEFEST as well as the first in
            our hearts! Oh... and you have to order an electric shark ü¶à

            <strong>The Pinemoor</strong>A recent addition to the JUNEFEST bar
            lineup, but many of you Arlington locals remember it in its past
            life as Clarendon Grill. And we are pleased to report that the ethos
            of Clarendon Grill lives on in Pinemoor. What we mean by that is
            Pinemoor is the type of place where you can show up and say without
            judgement "bring me two beers (or a full bottle of champagne or
            whatever your drink of choice) and then bring me two more every
            seven minutes" until the word 'seven' sounds like 'sthelfen.'
          </p>
          <p>
            This is only further enabled by the fact that the good people at
            Pinemoor reserve the entire outdoor patio for us. So let's make sure
            that we're all on our best behavior, or at least leave enough gray
            area and tip well, so that they continue to have us back year in and
            year out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, be sure to give a quick thought or pour two out for our fallen
            friend, Clarendon Grill.

            <strong>Coco B</strong>What do Mickey Mantle, Kendall Roy and Coco
            B's all have in common? They all tried to replace titans in their
            respective fields. As you may know, Coco B's is the successor to the
            most iconic of all JUNEFEST bars, the late, great Whitlow's on
            Wilson. There's a lot of pressure on Coco B's to carry on Whitlow's
            legendary legacy. It's never easy to follow in the footsteps of an
            all time great. However, with the continued prime rooftop location
            and tiki bar theme, we are confident that this new, yet familiar,
            watering hole can live up to the hype. At the very least, let's hope
            we don't end up comparing it to Kendall Roy.

            <strong>Clarendon Ballroom</strong>Overshadowed for years by our
            beloved Whitlow‚Äôs and its more recognizable neighbors, Spider
            Kelly‚Äôs and Don Tito, Clarendon Ballroom is a potential hidden gem
            of the JUNEFEST bar universe. In the words of Stefan from Saturday
            Night Live, ‚ÄúThis place has everything.‚Äù Ballroom is littered with
            amenities that scream JUNEFEST: beach balls and flamingos, stiff but
            tropical drinks, games, cabanas, good vibes, and a playlist that‚Äôll
            make you think you just crossed the invisible line dividing the boys
            and girls at your middle school dance. You get the point. This place
            slaps.

            <strong>The Lot</strong>The nightcap and final stop of our JUNEFEST
            bar crawl. If the rest of your day is done correctly, the lights at
            The Lot (and just about everything else) might be a tad blurry. And
            that's ok so long as you are still upright and standing.
          </p>
          <p>
            JUNEFEST is a marathon, not a sprint, except it's far more
            physically and mentally demanding than running 26.2 miles. So if you
            make it all the way to The Lot, you deserve to kick back, take in
            the blurry sights and sounds, and enjoy your accomplishment to the
            tune of an $8 White Claw. #LotBy9
